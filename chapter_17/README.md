# Amortized Analysis

Guarantees an average performance of each operation in the worst case. E.g., table doubling in an array for insert. Pretty straightforward; I already understood the concept prior to reviewing this, so won't write much here. It presents three different methods for amortizing operation costs: Aggregate analysis, the accounting method, and the potential method. 17.4 uses table doubling as an example, showing its amortized cost is O(1).
