# Greedy Algorithms

From the first paragraph: "Algorithms for optimization problems typically go through a sequence of steps, with a set of choices at each step. For many optimization problems, using dynamic programming to determine the best choices is overkill; simpler, more efficient algorithms will do. a **greedy algorithm** always makes the choice that looks best at the moment--that is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this will lead to a globally optimal solution.
