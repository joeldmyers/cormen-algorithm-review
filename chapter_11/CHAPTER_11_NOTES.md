# Hash Tables

I also skipped implementing these; I implemented it in other repos. It's mostly very basic / straightforward explanation of how to implement hash tables. Open addressing and perfect hashing are topics I may review later on, but I think generally speaking, understanding how hash tables work and being able to implement with a linked list for collisions is sufficient.
