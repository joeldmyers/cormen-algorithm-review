# Sorting in Linear Time

All sort methods prior to this chapter are comparison sorts. Those are at best O of n log n time; there's no way to improve with comparison.

Linear time sorting takes advantage of properties of numbers to circumvent this limitation.

Bucket sort is in here, skipping implementing for now in the interest of time.
