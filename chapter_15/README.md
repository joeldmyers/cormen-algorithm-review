# Dynamic Programming

## Steps for Dynamic Programming:

1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up way.
4. Construct an optimal solution from computed information.
