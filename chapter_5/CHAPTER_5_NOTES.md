This was a chapter on probability analysis of random algorithms, such as "the hiring problem", where one has to estimate the expected costs of hiring given that the "most qualified candidate seen so far" arrives randomly and a higher cost (say recruiter fee) for hiring comes on the arrival of this random event. The TLDR for me is that you just take the ex ante expected probability of the event. The book phrases it differenty.
