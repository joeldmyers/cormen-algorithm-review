# Binary Search Trees

Binary Search Tree supports many operations, including search, min, max, predecessor, successor, insert and delete. So it can be used as both a dictionary and a priority queue.

Note that the implementation in chapter 12 includes a node having a parent, which (at least to my knowledge) is usually left out in implementations seen in LC problems.
