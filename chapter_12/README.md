# Binary Search Trees

Binary Search Tree supports many operations, including search, min, max, predecessor, successor, insert and delete. So it can be used as both a dictionary and a priority queue.

Note that the implementation in chapter 12 includes a node having a parent, which seems to be often left out of other problems I've seen. My understanding is that, at least from what I've seen, a parent is going to be required for red-black trees, but not for AVL trees (which instead have a value of height).
